                I'm Jordan, a software engineer mostly focused on front-end
                development but fully capable of back-end work. I'm skilled in
                HTML, CSS (especially TailwindCSS), JavaScript, and React.
                Lately, I've been diving into TypeScript, NextJS, Remix, and
                Supabase. I'm self sufficient and capable of troubleshooting
                using any and all available resources.

              <h2 className="">Experience</h2>
              <p className="">
                Most recently, I worked as a cook at a high-level restaurant in
                downtown Manhattan and before that, I was a teaching assistant
                at a software engineer bootcamp. I've also served in the Army
                and worked as a residential electrician so I've definitely got a
                well-rounded background and I'm ready to handle those "
                <i>can you believe this shit?</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;" moments.
              </p>

              <h2 className="">Interests</h2>
              <p className="">
                Besides my technical chops, I consider myself a laid-back person
                with diverse interests. People usually find me friendly and
                easygoing. I've got a strong work ethic and love learning new
                things. Outside of web dev, I'm an avid PC gamer (League of
                Legends player for well over a decade so...there's that), pro
                wrestling fan and occasionally I'll even pick up my guitar and
                bass and mess around.
